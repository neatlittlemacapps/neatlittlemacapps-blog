# Tag

Non-interactive labels that communicate semantic meaning.

## Anatomy

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Container/wrapper | Defines tag shape and padding. |
| Text | 1-2 word label describing status/category. |
| Color/background | Semantic color indicating meaning. |
| Optional icon | Visual reinforcement of meaning. |

## Usage

• Use tags to communicate semantic meaning (status, category, score).
• Apply tags as visual labels, not interactive elements.
• Keep tag text to 1-2 words maximum.
• Use consistent semantic colors across contexts.
• Align tags with related content.

## Behaviour / States

| State | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Default | Tag displays static semantic information. |
| Non-interactive | Tags do not respond to hover or click. |

## Best Practices

• Keep content to 1-2 words.
• Use semantic colors consistently.
• Align with content, don't obscure it.
