# Accessibility

Creating inclusive experiences for all users is a core principle of the Infinitas Learning Design System.

## Standards

We aim for **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** compliance across all products.

## Key Principles

### 1. Perceivable
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Make content adaptable to different devices and screen sizes

### 2. Operable
- Make all functionality keyboard accessible
- Provide enough time for users to read and interact with content
- Design navigation that helps users find content easily

### 3. Understandable
- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate in predictable ways
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust
- Maximize compatibility with current and future tools
- Use semantic HTML
- Ensure proper ARIA labels when needed
